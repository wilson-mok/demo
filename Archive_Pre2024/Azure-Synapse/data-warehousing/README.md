### Pre-req
For this demo, we require: 
1. Azure Synapse Analytics with a Dedicated SQL pools (Size: DW100c)
1. Azure Storage with hierarchical namespace enabled (Data Lake gen 2)

| src/azureSql/data/ | This folder contains all the SQL files for the Azure SQL database. Please run CreateSchema.sql first then the rest of the table files can be ran in any order. |
| src/azureSql/queries.sql | This file contains the queries used to build better understand of the data in the Azure SQL database. |
| src/data-warehouse/createDWHScript.sql | This SQL script will create the schema and the dimensional data model in the Dedicated SQL Pool. |
| src/data-warehouse/queries.sql | This SQL script contains the queries to validate the result of the data pipeline. |
| src/synapse-pipeline/ | This folder contains all the Synapse JSON code. You need to make changes to the Linked services using your Azure resources. |
