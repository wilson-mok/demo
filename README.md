## Azure Databricks | Azure Data Factory | Building streaming data pipelines with Medallion architecture
We have reached the fourth and final part of the Azure Databricks series. In this session, I will cover:
   * Design and implement streaming pipelines using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory.
   * A quick introduction to Delta Live Table in Azure Databricks.

After this session, you will be able to create your own streaming data pipeline for your Lakehouse using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory.

## Azure Databricks | Azure Data Factory | Develop data pipelines for a Medallion delta lake using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory
In this session, I will cover:
   * What is a Medallion delta lake architecture
   * Design and demo AutoLoader and structure streaming (Micro-batching) for batch processing using Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks.
   * Using Databricks Serverless SQL to serve data to PowerBI.

After this session, you will be able to create your own streaming solution using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory.

## Azure Databricks | Azure Data Factory | Building your first data pipeline
This session is the second installment of a four-part series. In this session, I will discuss: 
   * Introduce Delta Lake format.
   * Discuss different types of Databricks clusters and assoicated costs.
   * Introduce Azure Data Factory and how we can schedule your data pipeline.
   * A demo of using Azure Data Factory and Databricks to schedule your data pipeline.

At the end of this session, you will be able to create your own data pipeline and create a schedule for it to run automatically using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory.
